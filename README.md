## 🤖 <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

**Zen'Co** is a mobile app designed to make shared living easier. Whether you're splitting chores, managing shared expenses, or sharing important info with your housemates — everything is organized in one smooth and user-friendly app.

This project is based on a **UI design by [Eline Neilz](https://elineneilz.framer.website/projets/zen-co-app)**, and I asked her permission to turn it into a personal **side project** using React Native.

## ⚙️ <a name="tech-stack">Tech Stack</a>

**[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** is a JavaScript framework developed by Meta (Facebook) that allows you to build mobile applications using React. It enables developers to write cross-platform apps (iOS & Android) with a shared codebase, while still delivering a native look and feel.

**[Expo](https://expo.dev/)** is an open-source platform built on top of React Native that simplifies the development workflow. It provides a set of tools and services (such as OTA updates, build systems, and device previews) that make building, testing, and deploying React Native apps faster and easier — especially for solo developers and small teams.

**[Native Wind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)** brings Tailwind CSS to React Native. It allows developers to use utility-first styling in their mobile apps, which significantly improves development speed, readability, and consistency in UI design. Under the hood, it compiles Tailwind-like class names into performant stylesheets for native apps.

**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection for developers, making it ideal for building large-scale applications.

**[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)** is a lightweight and flexible state management library for React. Unlike more complex tools like Redux, Zustand offers a simpler API and better performance, making it ideal for managing shared state in React Native apps without boilerplate.
